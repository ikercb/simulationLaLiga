# Goal Prediction in La Liga using Poisson Regression

The goal of this project is to collect and analyze football data with a focus on the Spanish football league: La Liga. Differently to other sports like basketball, scoring is scarce in football. The low-scoring nature of the game makes Poisson regression a good starting point to predict the scoring of football matches. Furthermore, we use a Poisson model to carry out a Monte Carlo simulation to predict the probability of each team to win the league before the last three gameweeks are played.
